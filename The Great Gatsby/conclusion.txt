Stage[edit]
Gatsby has been adapted for the stage multiple times since its publication. The first known stage adaptation was by American dramatist Owen Davis,[256] which became the 1926 film version. The play, directed by George Cukor, opened on Broadway on February 2, 1926, and had 112 curtain calls. A successful tour later in the year included performances in Chicago, August 1 through October 2.[257] More recently, The New York Metropolitan Opera commissioned John Harbison to compose an operatic treatment of the novel to commemorate the 25th anniversary of James Levine's debut. The work, called The Great Gatsby, premiered on December 20, 1999.[258] In July 2006, Simon Levy's stage adaptation, directed by David Esbjornson, premiered at the Guthrie Theater to commemorate the opening of its new theater.[259] In 2010, critic Ben Brantley of the New York Times highly praised the debut of Gatz, an Off-Broadway production by Elevator Repair Service.[260] The novel has also been adapted for ballet performances. In 2009, BalletMet premiered a version at the Capitol Theatre in Columbus, Ohio.[261] In 2010, The Washington Ballet premiered a version at the Kennedy Center. The show received an encore run the following year.[262]

The 1926 film trailerâ€”the only extant footage
The first movie version of the novel debuted in 1926. Itself a version of Owen Davis's Broadway play, it was directed by Herbert Brenon and starred Warner Baxter, Lois Wilson and William Powell. It is a famous example of a lost film. Reviews suggest it may have been the most faithful adaptation of the novel, but a trailer of the film at the National Archives is all that is known to exist.[263] Reportedly, Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda loathed the silent version. Zelda wrote to an acquaintance that the film was "rotten". She and Scott left the cinema midway through the film.[264]

Following the 1926 movie was 1949's The Great Gatsby, directed by Elliott Nugent and starring Alan Ladd, Betty Field and Macdonald Carey.[265] Twenty-five years later in 1974, The Great Gatsby appeared onscreen again. It was directed by Jack Clayton and starred Robert Redford as Gatsby, Mia Farrow as Daisy, and Sam Waterston as Nick Carraway.[265] Most recently, The Great Gatsby was directed by Baz Luhrmann in 2013 and starred Leonardo DiCaprio as Gatsby, Carey Mulligan as Daisy, and Tobey Maguire as Nick.[264]

In 2021, visual effects company DNEG announced they would be producing an animated film adaptation of the novel directed by William Joyce and written by Brian Selznick.[266]

In 2021, a fan-written screenplay for a Muppet adaptation titled "Muppets Present The Great Gatsby" went viral.[267]

Television[edit]
Gatsby has been recast multiple times as a short-form television movie. The first was in 1955 as an NBC episode for Robert Montgomery Presents starring Robert Montgomery, Phyllis Kirk, and Lee Bowman. The episode was directed by Alvin Sapinsley.[268] In 1958, CBS filmed another adaptation as an episode of Playhouse 90, also titled The Great Gatsby, which was directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and starred Robert Ryan, Jeanne Crain and Rod Taylor.[269] Most recently, the novel was adapted as an A&E movie in 2000. The Great Gatsby was directed by Robert Markowitz and starred Toby Stephens as Gatsby, Mira Sorvino as Daisy, and Paul Rudd as Nick.[270][269]

Graphic novels[edit]
The Great Gatsby has been adapted into three graphic novels. The first was in 2007 by Nicki Greenberg, who published "The Great Gatsby: A Graphic Adaptation" in Australia. Because the original novel was still protected by United States copyright laws, this version was never published in the United States. The second version, "The Great Gatsby: The Graphic Novel," was adapted by Fred Fordham and illustrated by Aya Morton in 2020. Finally, in 2021, K. Woodman-Maynard adapted and illustrated "The Great Gatsby: A Graphic Novel Adaptation," which was published by Candlewick Press.[271] This was the first graphic novel adaptation of the original novel to be published after it entered the public domain in 2021.

Radio[edit]
The novel has been adapted into series of radio episodes. The first radio episode was a 1950 half-hour-long adaptation for CBS' Family Hour of Stars starring Kirk Douglas as Gatsby.[272] The novel was read aloud by the BBC World Service in ten parts in 2008. In a 2012 BBC Radio 4 broadcast, The Great Gatsby took the form of a Classic Serial dramatization. It was created by dramatist Robert Forrest.[273][274]

Video Games[edit]
In 2010, Oberon Media released a casual hidden object game called Classic Adventures: The Great Gatsby.[275][276] In 2011, developer Charlie Hoey and editor Pete Smith created an 8-bit-style online game of The Great Gatsby called The Great Gatsby for NES;[277][278][279] in 2022, after the Adobe Flash end of life they adapted this game to an actual NES ROM file, which can also be played on their website.[280][281] In 2013, Slate released a short symbolic adaptation called The Great Gatsby: The Video Game.

Fitzgerald began outlining his third novel in June 1922.[7] He longed to produce an exquisite work that was beautiful and intricately patterned,[58] but the troubled production of his stage play The Vegetable repeatedly interrupted his progress.[59] The play flopped, and Fitzgerald wrote magazine stories that winter to pay debts incurred by its production.[60] He viewed these stories as all worthless,[59] although included among them was "Winter Dreams", which Fitzgerald described as his first attempt at the Gatsby idea.[61] "The whole idea of Gatsby", he later explained to a friend, "is the unfairness of a poor young man not being able to marry a girl with money. This theme comes up again and again because I lived it".[62]

In October 1922, after the birth of their only child, Frances Scott "Scottie" Fitzgerald, the Fitzgeralds moved to Great Neck, New York, on Long Island.[63] Their neighbors in Great Neck included such newly wealthy personages as writer Ring Lardner, actor Lew Fields and comedian Ed Wynn.[7] These figures were all considered to be nouveau riche (new rich), unlike those who came from Manhasset Neck, which sat across the bay from Great Neck—places that were home to many of New York's wealthiest established families.[64] This real-life juxtaposition gave Fitzgerald his idea for "West Egg" and "East Egg". In the novel, Great Neck (Kings Point) became the "new money" peninsula of West Egg and Port Washington (Sands Point) became the "old money" East Egg.[64] Several Gold Coast mansions in the area served as inspiration for Gatsby's estate including Land's End,[65] Oheka Castle,[66] and the since-demolished Beacon Towers.[67]

While living on Long Island, the Fitzgeralds' enigmatic neighbor was Max Gerlach.[e][36][71] Purportedly born in America to a German immigrant family,[f] Gerlach had been a major in the American Expeditionary Forces during World War I, and he later became a gentleman bootlegger who lived like a millionaire in New York.[73] Flaunting his new wealth,[g] Gerlach threw lavish parties,[75] never wore the same shirt twice,[76] used the phrase "old sport",[77] and fostered myths about himself including that he was a relation of the German Kaiser.[78] These details about Gerlach inspired Fitzgerald in his creation of Jay Gatsby.[79]

During this same time period, the daily newspapers sensationalized the Hall–Mills murder case over many months, and the highly publicized case likely influenced the plot of Fitzgerald's novel.[80] The case involved the double-murder of a man and his lover on September 14, 1922, mere weeks before Fitzgerald arrived in Great Neck. Scholars have speculated that Fitzgerald based certain aspects of the ending of The Great Gatsby and various characterizations on this factual incident.[81]

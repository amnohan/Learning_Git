Inspired by the Hallsâ€“Mills case, the mysterious persona of Gerlach and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island, Fitzgerald had written 18,000 words for his novel by mid-1923 but discarded most of his new story as a false start.[82] Some of this early draft resurfaced in the 1924 short story "Absolution".[83] In earlier drafts,[h] Daisy was originally named Ada and Nick was Dud,[85] and the two characters had shared a previous romance prior to their reunion on Long Island.[86] These earlier drafts were written from the viewpoint of an omniscient narrator as opposed to Nick's perspective.[87] A key difference in earlier drafts is a less complete failure of Gatsby's dream.[88] Another difference is that the argument between Tom Buchanan and Gatsby is more balanced, although Daisy still returns to Tom.[88]

Work on The Great Gatsby resumed in earnest in April 1924.[89] Fitzgerald decided to depart from the writing process of his previous novels and told Perkins that he was intent on creating an artistic achievement.[90] He wished to eschew the realism of his previous two novels and to compose a creative work of sustained imagination.[91] To this end, he consciously imitated the literary styles of Joseph Conrad and Willa Cather.[92] He was particularly influenced by Cather's 1923 work, A Lost Lady,[93] which features a wealthy married socialite pursued by a variety of romantic suitors and who symbolically embodies the American dream.[94][95] He later wrote a letter to Cather apologizing for any unintentional plagiarism.[93] During this period of revisions, Scott saw and was influenced by early sketches for the book's cover art.[96][97] Soon after this burst of effort, work slowed while the Fitzgeralds moved to the French Riviera, where a marital crisis soon developed.[i]

Despite his ongoing marital tension, Fitzgerald continued to write steadily and submitted a near-final version of the manuscript to his editor, Maxwell Perkins, on October 27.[99] Perkins informed him in a November letter that Gatsby was too vague as a character and that his wealth and business, respectively, needed a convincing explanation.[100] Fitzgerald thanked Perkins for his detailed criticisms and claimed that such feedback would enable him to perfect the manuscript.[101] Having relocated with his wife to Rome,[102] Fitzgerald made revisions to the manuscript throughout the winter.[100]

Content after a few rounds of revision, Fitzgerald submitted the final version in February 1925.[103] Fitzgerald's alterations included extensive revisions of the sixth and eighth chapters.[104] He declined an offer of $10,000 for the serial rights to the book so that it could be published sooner.[105] He received a $3,939 advance in 1923 and would receive $1,981.25 upon publication.
